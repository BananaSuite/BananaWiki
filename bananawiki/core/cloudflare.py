"""Cloudflare's edge address ranges, for servers behind proxied (orange-cloud) records.

Used by the Caddy configuration (``bananawiki.ops.caddy``: trust
``CF-Connecting-IP`` only from these peers, serve Cloudflare "Flexible" requests
instead of redirecting them in a loop) and by the custom domain DNS check
(a proxied record resolves to these addresses, not to the platform's).

Standard library only: the ``banana`` controller imports it with the system
Python. Source: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4 and /ips-v6 (also
``https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips``); refresh the lists when
Cloudflare announces a change.
